TokenStep is designed as a local-first usage tracker.

## What TokenStep Reads

TokenStep reads local metadata from supported agent logs:

- date or timestamp
- model name when present
- client name
- token usage counts

## What TokenStep Does Not Do

TokenStep does not upload anything by default.

TokenStep does not need to send your code, prompts, or conversation text to any server.

## Optional Quota Display

The Agent quota display is off by default.

When enabled, TokenStep may read local account metadata needed by supported tools:

- Claude Code quota is read by using the local macOS Keychain item for Claude Code and requesting Anthropic's OAuth usage endpoint.
- Codex quota (weekly window only; the 5-hour quota was retired on 2026-08-13) is read from the local Codex account/rate limit interface.

TokenStep uses this only to show remaining quota. The account token is not stored by TokenStep and is not uploaded to a TokenStep server.

## Local Files

Generated app data is stored at:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/TokenStep
```

This folder contains settings, token summaries, freshness records (timestamps and
safe error categories only — no paths, no error text), and login item logs.

## Project Dimension

TokenStep extracts a project name from each agent session (the last folder
name of the working directory, e.g. `my-app`). **Full paths are never
persisted, displayed, or shared** — only the folder name. Folders whose name
cannot be represented (e.g. fully stripped encodings) are grouped under
Unnamed project. Project names appear in the Today card, stats, share cards,
and (in the future) opt-in multi-device sync payloads.

## Cost Estimates

The "spend" value is a rough local estimate based on bundled API list prices
(UI label: 消耗金额（估算）). It is meant for trend tracking and is not a bill,
a subscription entitlement, or an actual invoice.

## Data Freshness States

TokenStep distinguishes the freshness of every number it shows: 已同步 (fresh),
数据待更新 (aging), 同步失败 · 显示最后成功数据 (stale, keeps the last successful
value), 部分来源失败 (partial), and 暂无数据 (never captured — never displayed as 0).
Quota channels (Codex / Claude Code) report these states independently; one provider
failing never masks the other. See `docs/DATA_TRUST.md` for the full vocabulary.

## Agent Work Rank (Opt-In)

The optional Agent Work rank card is strictly opt-in:

- New installs default to **hidden**. While hidden, TokenStep performs **zero local identity reads and zero leaderboard requests**, and no rank card is shown.
- Enabling it (自动 / 显示 in Settings) is an explicit user action. Only then does TokenStep read the local rank identity file (`~/.token-rank/client-state.json`, user id / display name / avatar URL only) and request the public leaderboard endpoint (`www.zhenganhuo.com/api/token-rank/leaderboard.php`).
- The enabled leaderboard displays public account IDs, display names, ranks, and Token totals returned by that endpoint, ordered locally from highest to lowest Token usage. The current local identity is highlighted when it matches a returned account.
- Because browser cookies are not shared with TokenStep, users without the Token Rank desktop identity file can explicitly choose their own public row. TokenStep then stores only that public account ID and display name in its local settings; it stores no website cookie, password, email, or session token.
- If no public identity is selected, TokenStep adds a local-only current member using the macOS account display name and the already-collected local today Token total. This overlay is ranked in memory with the public rows and is never uploaded to Token Rank.
- Switching back to 隐藏 immediately clears the in-memory identity, leaderboard, and error state, and stops all reads and requests.
- Legacy settings never silently enable the rank card: unrecognized legacy fields and explicit legacy "off" both migrate to hidden; only an explicit legacy "on" preserves visibility.
- TokenStep never uploads your local usage statistics to the leaderboard. Rank data shown comes from the public leaderboard API only.

## Future Sync Features

If TokenStep later adds cloud sync, it should be opt-in and should require a separate confirmation before uploading any data.
