# Data Trust Contract

TokenStep solves *visibility*, not *settlement*. Usage numbers are self-reported local
telemetry: they are parsed from local agent logs on a machine the user fully controls,
and are good for trends, quotas and rhythm — not for billing, reimbursement, or rewards.

## Version Contract (E0 freeze)

Three independent version concepts. They must never be conflated or used to backfill
each other's changes:

| Version | Scope | When it changes |
|---|---|---|
| `codexAccountingRevision` | Token computation semantics for **one source** (currently Codex) | Only when that source's token results may change. Bumping it invalidates the collector cache and drives the in-app recalibration notice. It must NOT be bumped for other sources, storage changes, or pricing changes. |
| Storage schema version | Physical layout of `data/usage.json`, `cache/*.json`, `cache/codex-incremental.sqlite3` | When tables, fields, or encoding structures migrate. Old files must stay readable (`decodeIfPresent` with defaults). |
| Pricing snapshot revision | The bundled/estimated pricing dataset and its date | When estimated prices change. Reserved for future use — remote pricing is **not** implemented (see B01 backlog gate). |

Current values at v0.1.48 + E0: `codexAccountingRevision = 8`; storage schema is
implicit per Codable defaults; no pricing revision exists yet.

## Evidence Status Vocabulary (normative for UI and docs)

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 官方数据 / official | Returned by a vendor interface (quota services) |
| 本地记录 / local record | Parsed by TokenStep from local logs or databases |
| 估算 / estimate | Computed from rules or bundled list prices — never a bill |
| 已过期 / stale | Last attempt failed; the shown value is the last success |

Cost values are estimates from bundled API list prices. They do not represent
subscription entitlements or actual invoices.

## Freshness States (V1-T01, normative)

One state model for three channels (local collection, Codex quota, Claude quota),
computed by `FreshnessPolicy` — thresholds live only in the policy, never in views:

| State | 用户可见标签 | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `neverSucceeded` | 暂无数据 | Never captured; UI must never show 0 for it |
| `fresh` | 已同步 | Last success within the normal TTL |
| `aging` | 数据待更新 | Past the normal TTL, latest attempt not failed |
| `stale` | 同步失败 · 显示最后成功数据 | Latest attempt failed while an old value is shown, or age > 2× TTL |
| `partial` | 部分来源失败 | Same refresh cycle: ≥1 enabled source OK and ≥1 failed |
| `disabled` | 已关闭 | Feature off (quota toggle) |

TTLs: collection = user refresh interval bounded by `EnergyRefreshPolicy` retry floor;
quota = 15 min (`EnergyRefreshPolicy.quotaTTL`); stale = 2× normal TTL.
Per-channel records distinguish `lastAttemptedAt` / `lastSucceededAt` / `lastFailedAt`
plus a safe error kind — Codex and Claude quota failures never mask each other.

## Agent Work Rank Data Flows (post E0-T03)

- Default: `agentWorkRankVisibility = .hidden` → 0 local identity reads, 0 leaderboard
  requests, no rank UI.
- Enabled by explicit user choice only; reads whitelisted identity fields
  (id / name / avatar URL) from `~/.token-rank/client-state.json` and calls the public
  leaderboard API (30 min cache TTL, 15 min retry policy via EnergyRefreshPolicy).
- Returned members are ordered locally by `total_tokens` descending. The dashboard
  shows account ID, display name, and Token usage, and highlights the locally matched
  account. If that account is not in the returned top rows, local today usage is shown
  as an explicitly local fallback rather than being presented as remote rank data.
- The dashboard does not impose a client-side row limit. It renders every row returned
  by the public API and reports `returned / total_ranked_users` when the service applies
  its own top-list limit.
- Browser sessions are intentionally not imported. Without the Token Rank desktop
  identity file, an explicit “set as current account” action stores only the selected
  public user ID and display name in TokenStep settings.
- With no public identity, the local dashboard synthesizes one current-account row from
  `NSFullUserName()` / `NSUserName()` and the local `today.total_tokens`. It is merged and
  ranked only in memory and is never sent to the leaderboard service.
- Disabling clears identity, leaderboard, and error state in memory.
- Legacy migration: unrecognized legacy fields → hidden; legacy explicit on → visible;
  legacy explicit off → hidden.

## Source Diagnostics

`sources` in `data/usage.json` exposes per-source status, record counts, and accounting
counters (`counter_resets`, `inherited_tokens`, …). Statuses considered successful by
the freshness policy: `ok`, `ok_sqlite`. Absent statuses (`disabled`, `missing`,
`missing_db`, `missing_valid_rows`) mean "no data from this source today" and never
trigger partial-failure. Everything else (e.g. `incremental_cache_error`) counts as an
enabled-but-failed source. Diagnostics are the primary evidence for "is today's number
complete?" and feed the trust labels.

## Project Dimension (V-B1)

- Extraction: Claude per-line `cwd`; Codex `session_meta.payload.cwd`.
- Storage: last path component only (≤64 chars, must contain a letter/digit;
  symbol-only names → Unnamed). Empty name groups under Unnamed project.
- Codex incremental cache: project rides per-record blobs; tail appends inherit
  the session's stored project (fixture-verified); old caches backfill on the
  next natural rescan/validation (records equality includes the new field).
- Claude collector cache: replayed entries without a project stay Unnamed until
  the file changes (active sessions refresh immediately).
- Snapshot schema: `projects` additive, `decodeIfPresent` (legacy reads OK).

## Local Data, Network Requests and Retention

| Item | Location | Network | Retention |
|---|---|---|---|
| Usage warehouse | `data/usage.json` | none | local only, follows user data |
| Collector caches | `cache/collector-cache.json`, `cache/codex-incremental.sqlite3`, `cache/collection-checkpoint.json` | none | rebuilt on demand |
| Quota caches | `cache/claude-quota-cache.json` (+ in-memory Codex weekly) | Anthropic usage API; Codex local CLI/app-server (weekly only; 5h retired 2026-08-13) | TTL 15 min |
| Freshness records (V1) | `cache/freshness-state.json` | none | timestamps + safe error kinds only; no paths, no error text |
| Settings | `config/settings.json` | none | local only |
| Agent rank (opt-in) | in-memory + public leaderboard API | zhenganhuo.com only when explicitly enabled | 30 min cache |

## Known Boundaries

| Source | Tier | Data location | 口径 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Codex | official | `~/.codex/sessions` + `archived_sessions` JSONL; SQLite fallback `state_5.sqlite` | cumulative counters → deltas; incremental SQLite cache |
| Claude Code | official | `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` | per-message usage, dedup by message id |
| CC Switch Proxy | experimental | `~/.cc-switch/cc-switch.db` `proxy_request_logs` | 2xx + tokens>0; cross-source dedup |
| ZCode / Hermes / WorkBuddy | experimental (off by default) | local DBs / JSONL | see AGENT_SUPPORT.md |

- Codex native logs are cumulative counters; TokenStep derives deltas and handles
  resets/forks, but replayed or rewritten logs can still shift attribution.
- CC Switch proxy rows are deduplicated against native records by request identity;
  unmatched proxy rows are kept under their own client name.
- Cost estimates use hardcoded list prices until pricing revision B01 is activated.
  UI labels say 消耗金额（估算）; the disclaimer reads 按 API 列表价估算，不代表订阅或实际账单。
